# Running Pac-Man on Kubernetes

Pac-Man the classic arcade game - deployment files for Aruba Managed Kubernetes and all other Kubernetes distributions.

## Pre-Reqs

ServiceType: LoadBalancer must be available for external connectivity to the Pac-Man front-end, otherwise you'll need to make some changes to the files in the "services" folder.

## Deployment

### Using a Script for installation
Clone repo and run ```chmod +X pacman-install.sh``` and then run file ```./pacman-install.sh```

or the following steps:

    kubectl create namespace pacman
    kubectl create -n pacman -f pacman-tanzu/

#### Uninstall using a Script
Run file `./pacman-uninstall.sh`. This will delete all objects created by `./pacman-install.sh`

Alternatively, run `./pacman-uninstall.sh keeppvc`. This will delete all objects except for the pacman namespace and the persistent volume claim. You can use this to demonstrate persistence of the MongoDB data by installing, playing a game and recording a high score, then unininstalling with the `keeppvc` argument. You can then run the installation again and the high score will persist.

## Architecture

The application is made up of the following components:

* Namespace
* Deployment
  * MongoDB Pod
    * DB Authentication configured
    * Attached to a PVC
  * Pac-Man Pod
    * Nodejs web front end that connects back to the MongoDB Pod by looking for the Pod DNS address internally.
* RBAC Configuration for Pod Security and Service Account
* Secret which holds the data for the MongoDB Usernames and Passwords to be configured
* Service
  * Type: LoadBalancer
    * Used to balance traffic to the Pac-Man Pods

## Source

These are modified files from the below github repo for the node.js version, which contain the necessary changes to run in Aruba Managed Kubernetes such as updated api values with associated service accounts and RBAC.
